# 11785-Speech-Denoising

This is the repository for the course project for 11785-Introduction to Deep Learning. We worked on image denoising using deep learning. This repository contains the Jupyter notebooks used for the project. They are organized as below:

- Acoustic_Features_Analysis.ipynb : Get acoustic features for clean, noisy, and processed samples. Measure MAE and imrovement in it because of processing
- Test_Data_Metrics : Measure pairwise metrics of clean and processed data
- FullSubNet/FullSubNet_Inference.ipynb : Run inference on noisy audio files using FullSubNet model
- FullSubNet/11785_S23_FullSubNet_Training_Example.ipynb : Train or fine tune FullSubNet models
- Demucs/11785_S23_Demucs_Training_and_Inference.ipynb : Train/fine tune and run inference on Demucs models
